## AGENT.md
https://agents.md/

2. 标准文件结构与内容
AGENTS.md 是一个标准的 Markdown 文件，通常放置在项目根目录或 .github/ 目录下。它不依赖复杂的 Schema，而是利用 LLM 强大的自然语言理解能力，通过清晰的标题和列表来传递指令。

一个典型的 AGENTS.md 包含以下关键板块：

环境上下文 (Context): 明确项目的具体技术栈版本（例如：“Next.js 14 (App Router), Tailwind CSS, TypeScript 5.0”），避免 AI 使用过时语法。
构建与测试指令 (Build & Test): 精确的命令序列。
示例： “运行测试必须使用 pnpm test，提交代码前必须通过所有 lint 检查。”
代码风格与规范 (Conventions): 具体的编码偏好。
示例： “使用函数式组件而非类组件”、“变量命名强制使用驼峰式 (camelCase)"、“所有接口必须定义在 types/ 目录下”。
行为边界 (Boundaries): 这是最重要的部分，规定 AI 的权限。
示例： “你可以修改 src/components 下的文件，但严禁修改 prisma/schema.prisma 数据库定义文件，除非得到明确授权。”
Git 工作流 (Workflow): Commit 信息格式、分支命名规则等。

# Sample AGENTS.md file

## Dev environment tips
- Use `pnpm dlx turbo run where <project_name>` to jump to a package instead of scanning with `ls`.
- Run `pnpm install --filter <project_name>` to add the package to your workspace so Vite, ESLint, and TypeScript can see it.
- Use `pnpm create vite@latest <project_name> -- --template react-ts` to spin up a new React + Vite package with TypeScript checks ready.
- Check the name field inside each package's package.json to confirm the right name—skip the top-level one.

## Testing instructions
- Find the CI plan in the .github/workflows folder.
- Run `pnpm turbo run test --filter <project_name>` to run every check defined for that package.
- From the package root you can just call `pnpm test`. The commit should pass all tests before you merge.
- To focus on one step, add the Vitest pattern: `pnpm vitest run -t "<test name>"`.
- Fix any test or type errors until the whole suite is green.
- After moving files or changing imports, run `pnpm lint --filter <project_name>` to be sure ESLint and TypeScript rules still pass.
- Add or update tests for the code you change, even if nobody asked.

## PR instructions
- Title format: [<project_name>] <Title>
- Always run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm test` before committing.

## Policies & Mandatory Rules

### Mandatory Skill Usage

#### `$code-change-verification`

Run `$code-change-verification` before marking work complete when changes affect runtime code, tests, or build/test behavior.

Run it when you change:
- `src/agents/` (library code) or shared utilities.
- `tests/` or add or modify snapshot tests.
- `examples/`.
- Build or test configuration such as `pyproject.toml`, `Makefile`, `mkdocs.yml`, `docs/scripts/`, or CI workflows.

You can skip `$code-change-verification` for docs-only or repo-meta changes (for example, `docs/`, `.agents/`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.github/`), unless a user explicitly asks to run the full verification stack.

#### `$openai-knowledge`

When working on OpenAI API or OpenAI platform integrations in this repo (Responses API, tools, streaming, Realtime API, auth, models, rate limits, MCP, Agents SDK or ChatGPT Apps SDK), use `$openai-knowledge` to pull authoritative docs via the OpenAI Developer Docs MCP server (and guide setup if it is not configured).

#### `$implementation-strategy`

Before changing runtime code, exported APIs, external configuration, persisted schemas, wire protocols, or other user-facing behavior, use `$implementation-strategy` to decide the compatibility boundary and implementation shape. Judge breaking changes against the latest release tag, not unreleased branch-local churn. Interfaces introduced or changed after the latest release tag may be rewritten without compatibility shims unless they define a released or explicitly supported durable external state boundary, or the user explicitly asks for a migration path. Unreleased persisted formats on `main` may be renumbered or squashed before release when intermediate snapshots are intentionally unsupported.

#### `$pr-draft-summary`

When a task in this repo finishes with moderate-or-larger code changes, invoke `$pr-draft-summary` in the final handoff to generate the required PR summary block, branch suggestion, title, and draft description. Treat this as the default close-out step after runtime code, tests, examples, build/test configuration, or docs with behavior impact are changed.

Skip `$pr-draft-summary` only for trivial or conversation-only tasks, repo-meta/doc-only tasks without behavior impact, or when the user explicitly says not to include the PR draft block.

### ExecPlans

Call out compatibility risk early in your plan only when the change affects behavior shipped in the latest release tag or a released or explicitly supported durable external state boundary, and confirm the approach before implementing changes that could impact users.

Use an ExecPlan when work is multi-step, spans several files, involves new features or refactors, or is likely to take more than about an hour. Start with the template and rules in `PLANS.md`, keep milestones and living sections (Progress, Surprises & Discoveries, Decision Log, Outcomes & Retrospective) up to date as you execute, and rewrite the plan if scope shifts. Call out compatibility risk only when the plan changes behavior shipped in the latest release tag or a released or explicitly supported durable external state boundary. Do not treat branch-local interface churn or unreleased post-tag changes on `main` as breaking by default; prefer direct replacement over compatibility layers in those cases, and renumber or squash unreleased persisted schemas before release when the intermediate snapshots are intentionally unsupported. If you intentionally skip an ExecPlan for a complex task, note why in your response so reviewers understand the choice.

### Public API Positional Compatibility

Treat the parameter and dataclass field order of exported runtime APIs as a compatibility contract.

- For public constructors (for example `RunConfig`, `FunctionTool`, `AgentHookContext`), preserve existing positional argument meaning. Do not insert new constructor parameters or dataclass fields in the middle of existing public order.
- When adding a new optional public field/parameter, append it to the end whenever possible and keep old fields in the same order.
- If reordering is unavoidable, add an explicit compatibility layer and regression tests that exercise the old positional call pattern.
- Prefer keyword arguments at call sites to reduce accidental breakage, but do not rely on this to justify breaking positional compatibility for public APIs.

## Project Structure Guide

### Overview

The OpenAI Agents Python repository provides the Python Agents SDK, examples, and documentation built with MkDocs. Use `uv run python ...` for Python commands to ensure a consistent environment.

### Repo Structure & Important Files

- `src/agents/`: Core library implementation.
- `tests/`: Test suite; see `tests/README.md` for snapshot guidance.
- `examples/`: Sample projects showing SDK usage.
- `docs/`: MkDocs documentation source; do not edit translated docs under `docs/ja`, `docs/ko`, or `docs/zh` (they are generated).
- `docs/scripts/`: Documentation utilities, including translation and reference generation.
- `mkdocs.yml`: Documentation site configuration.
- `Makefile`: Common developer commands.
- `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`: Python dependencies and tool configuration.
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/pull_request_template.md`: Pull request template to use when opening PRs.
- `site/`: Built documentation output.

### Agents Core Runtime Guidelines

- `src/agents/run.py` is the runtime entrypoint (`Runner`, `AgentRunner`). Keep it focused on orchestration and public flow control. Put new runtime logic under `src/agents/run_internal/` and import it into `run.py`.
- When `run.py` grows, refactor helpers into `run_internal/` modules (for example `run_loop.py`, `turn_resolution.py`, `tool_execution.py`, `session_persistence.py`) and leave only wiring and composition in `run.py`.
- Keep streaming and non-streaming paths behaviorally aligned. Changes to `run_internal/run_loop.py` (`run_single_turn`, `run_single_turn_streamed`, `get_new_response`, `start_streaming`) should be mirrored, and any new streaming item types must be reflected in `src/agents/stream_events.py`.
- Input guardrails run only on the first turn and only for the starting agent. Resuming an interruption from `RunState` must not increment the turn counter; only actual model calls advance turns.
- Server-managed conversation (`conversation_id`, `previous_response_id`, `auto_previous_response_id`) uses `OpenAIServerConversationTracker` in `run_internal/oai_conversation.py`. Only deltas should be sent. If `call_model_input_filter` is used, it must return `ModelInputData` with a list input and the tracker must be updated with the filtered input (`mark_input_as_sent`). Session persistence is disabled when server-managed conversation is active.
- Adding new tool/output/approval item types requires coordinated updates across:
  - `src/agents/items.py` (RunItem types and conversions)
  - `src/agents/run_internal/run_steps.py` (ProcessedResponse and tool run structs)
  - `src/agents/run_internal/turn_resolution.py` (model output processing, run item extraction)
  - `src/agents/run_internal/tool_execution.py` and `src/agents/run_internal/tool_planning.py`
  - `src/agents/run_internal/items.py` (normalization, dedupe, approval filtering)
  - `src/agents/stream_events.py` (stream event names)
  - `src/agents/run_state.py` (RunState serialization/deserialization)
  - `src/agents/run_internal/session_persistence.py` (session save/rewind)
- If the serialized RunState shape changes, update `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION` in `src/agents/run_state.py` and the related serialization/deserialization logic. Keep released schema versions readable, and feel free to renumber or squash unreleased schema versions before release when those intermediate snapshots are intentionally unsupported.

## Operation Guide

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+.
- `uv` installed for dependency management (`uv sync`) and `uv run` for Python commands.
- `make` available to run repository tasks.

### Development Workflow

1. Sync with `main` and create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/<short-description>
   ```
2. If dependencies changed or you are setting up the repo, run `make sync`.
3. Implement changes and add or update tests alongside code updates.
4. Highlight compatibility or API risks in your plan before implementing changes that alter the latest released behavior or a released or explicitly supported durable external state boundary.
5. Build docs when you touch documentation:
   ```bash
   make build-docs
   ```
6. When `$code-change-verification` applies, run it to execute the full verification stack before marking work complete.
7. Commit with concise, imperative messages; keep commits small and focused, then open a pull request.
8. When reporting code changes as complete (after substantial code work), invoke `$pr-draft-summary` as the final handoff step unless the task falls under the documented skip cases.

### Testing & Automated Checks

Before submitting changes, ensure relevant checks pass and extend tests when you touch code.

When `$code-change-verification` applies, run it to execute the required verification stack from the repository root. Rerun the full stack after applying fixes.

#### Unit tests and type checking

- Run the full test suite:
  ```bash
  make tests
  ```
- Run a focused test:
  ```bash
  uv run pytest -s -k <pattern>
  ```
- Type checking:
  ```bash
  make typecheck
  ```

#### Snapshot tests

Some tests rely on inline snapshots; see `tests/README.md` for details. Re-run `make tests` after updating snapshots.

- Fix snapshots:
  ```bash
  make snapshots-fix
  ```
- Create new snapshots:
  ```bash
  make snapshots-create
  ```

#### Coverage

- Generate coverage (fails if coverage drops below threshold):
  ```bash
  make coverage
  ```

#### Formatting, linting, and type checking

- Formatting and linting use `ruff`; run `make format` (applies fixes) and `make lint` (checks only).
- Type hints must pass `make typecheck`.
- Write comments as full sentences ending with a period.
- Imports are managed by Ruff and should stay sorted.

#### Mandatory local run order

When `$code-change-verification` applies, run the full sequence in order (or use the skill scripts):

```bash
make format
make lint
make typecheck
make tests
```

### Utilities & Tips

- Install or refresh development dependencies:
  ```bash
  make sync
  ```
- Run tests against the oldest supported version (Python 3.10) in an isolated environment:
  ```bash
  UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=.venv_310 uv sync --python 3.10 --all-extras --all-packages --group dev
  UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=.venv_310 uv run --python 3.10 -m pytest
  ```
- Documentation workflows:
  ```bash
  make build-docs      # build docs after editing docs
  make serve-docs      # preview docs locally
  make build-full-docs # run translations and build
  ```
- Snapshot helpers:
  ```bash
  make snapshots-fix
  make snapshots-create
  ```
- Use `examples/` to see common SDK usage patterns.
- Review `Makefile` for common commands and use `uv run` for Python invocations.
- Explore `docs/` and `docs/scripts/` to understand the documentation pipeline.
- Consult `tests/README.md` for test and snapshot workflows.
- Check `mkdocs.yml` to understand how docs are organized.

### Pull Request & Commit Guidelines

- Use the template at `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/pull_request_template.md`; include a summary, test plan, and issue number if applicable.
- Add tests for new behavior when feasible and update documentation for user-facing changes.
- Run `make format`, `make lint`, `make typecheck`, and `make tests` before marking work ready.
- Commit messages should be concise and written in the imperative mood. Small, focused commits are preferred.

### Review Process & What Reviewers Look For

- ✅ Checks pass (`make format`, `make lint`, `make typecheck`, `make tests`).
- ✅ Tests cover new behavior and edge cases.
- ✅ Code is readable, maintainable, and consistent with existing style.
- ✅ Public APIs and user-facing behavior changes are documented.
- ✅ Examples are updated if behavior changes.
- ✅ History is clean with a clear PR description.
